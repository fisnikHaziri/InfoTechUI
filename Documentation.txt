The navbar will display all the subjects and on select the asaide will apear
on the asaide there wil be the title of the subject and underneath it will be buttons containing the title of all the lessons that belong to that subject

On click the button will update the main component to display the title of the lesson and the context such as key points deep explenations and mayby other references 

^^^I left of here i have to do the Aside now and add the Bright colored bookmark idea for displaying the title's

The buttons will be fully colored and will look like bookmarks, the color of the button will be based on a randomly generated bright color
the uncovered lessons will be grayed out so will the uncovered subjects and will not have any functionality to them (Except mayby a popup modal that lets the user know that that is gated behind Teacher premmision) 

The project expects a User object from the backend that will contain booleans such as "HTML", "JavaScript".... based on which the UI will know wether to give premmision to view zed subject or not

example of how the userOBJ for covered subjects should look like:
    const UserFisnik = {
      HTML: true,
      JavaScript: true,
      React: false,
      CS: true,
      NetMVC: true,
      NetAPI: false,
    }
