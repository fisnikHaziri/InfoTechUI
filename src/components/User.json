						"<head> - wraps around website's metadata, such as tab title, language, viewport, etc",
						"<body> - is basically everything the user can see from the top of the page to the last element",
						"<h1> - with this tag we write Headings, which usually have bolder and bigger fonts, headings are ranged from 1 to 6, where 1 is the biggest and 6 is the smallest heading",
						"<p> - is the tag for writing paragraphs, these tags also consider adding space around the text so it looks just like a paragraph should",
						"<span> - is a simple tag for writing a piece of text, it is considered a block because it does not add space around the text"

					"content": "HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It serves as the backbone of every website, enabling developers to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements that make up a webpage. Using a system of tags and attributes, HTML organizes content hierarchically, ensuring accessibility and readability. While HTML alone structures the content, it integrates seamlessly with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it a fundamental building block of modern web development. Mastering HTML is the first step towards creating engaging and functional web experiences."
